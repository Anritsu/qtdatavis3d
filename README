-------------------------------------------------
Qt Data Visualization 0.1.0 (Techonology preview)
-------------------------------------------------

Qt Data Visualization module provides multiple graph types to visualize data in 3D space
both with C++ and Qt Quick 2.

System Requirements
===================

- Qt 5.1 or newer
- OpenGL 2.1 or newer (recommended) or OpenGL ES2 (reduced feature set)

Building
========
Configure the project with qmake:
    qmake

After running qmake, build the project with make:
    (Linux) make
    (Windows with MinGw) mingw32-make
    (Visual Studio) nmake
    (OSX) make

The above generates the default makefiles for your configuration, which is typically
the release build if you are using precompiled binary Qt distribution. To build both
debug and release, or one specifically, use one of the following qmake lines instead.

For debug builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=debug
    make
  or
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release
    make debug

For release builds:
    qmake CONFIG+=release
    make
  or
    qmake CONFIG+=debug_and_release
    make release

For both builds (Windows/Mac only):
    qmake CONFIG+="debug_and_release build_all"
    make

After building, install the module to your Qt directory:
    make install

If you want to uninstall the module:
    make uninstall

Building as a statically linked library
=======================================

The same as above applies, you will just have to add static to the CONFIG:
    qmake CONFIG+=static

Documentation
=============
Pregenerated documentation can be found from doc folder for both Qt Assistant
(qtdatavisualization.qch) and in HTML format (qtdatavisualization subfolder).

The documentation can also be generated with:
    make docs

Please refer to the generated documentation for more information:
    doc/qtdatavisualization/qtdatavisualization-index.html

Known Issues
============

The technology preview version is still missing some features entirely, while some
others may be only partially implemented. Here are some known issues:

- Scatter graphs can only show zero centered axis ranges properly.
- Value axis range of a bar graph with negative values need to be zero
  centered to display properly.
- Selection API is missing for surface graphs.
- Shadows do not work for surface graphs.
- Mac: Graphs drawn half the size on Retina displays.
- Using multiple graphs in one application crashes on application shutdown
  unless the last graph to have active context is deleted last.
- Android doesn't support both widgets and OpenGL simultaneously, so only
  the Qt Quick 2 API is usable in practice in Android.
- Shadows are not supported with OpenGL ES2 (including Angle builds in Windows).
- Anti-aliasing doesn't work with OpenGL ES2 (including Angle builds in Windows).
